## Salient Object Detection

* [RGBD Salient Object Detection: A Benchmark and Algorithms](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qyang/Docs/2009/tkde_transfer_learning.pdf) (2014 ECCV).   
The key points:
1. Introduce a large scale RGBD image dataset to address the problem of data deficiency. 
2. Provide a simple fusion framework that combines existing RGB-produced saliency with new depth-produced saliency. 
3. Propose a multi-stage RGBD model, which takes account of both depth and apperance cues derived from low-level feature contrast, mid-level region grounping and high-level priors enhancement. 



## Relation Extraction

* [A theory of learning from different domains](http://www.alexkulesza.com/pubs/adapt_mlj10.pdf) (2010)
