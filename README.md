## Salient Object Detection

### * [RGBD Salient Object Detection: A Benchmark and Algorithms](http://vigir.missouri.edu/~gdesouza/Research/Conference_CDs/ECCV_2014/html/8691/86910092.htm) (2014 ECCV).   
Motivations:
1. Current studies on RGBD salient object detection are lack of a benchmark dataset accurate depth data and unified evaluation metrics accurate depth data and unified evaluation metrics.
2. The effective strategy that makes existing RGB-based saliency computation models work well in RGBD scenarios is not well explored.  
3. Depth cues always work as an independent image channel for saliency detection in existing RGBD models, which inevitably ignores the strong complementarities between appearance and depth correspondence cues.  

Contributions:
1. Introduce a large scale RGBD image dataset to address the problem of data deficiency. 
2. Provide a simple fusion framework that combines existing RGB-produced saliency with new depth-produced saliency. 
3. Propose a multi-stage RGBD model, which takes account of both depth and apperance cues derived from low-level feature contrast, mid-level region grounping and high-level priors enhancement.
